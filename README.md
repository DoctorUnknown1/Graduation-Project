# Artificial Bin System (ABS)

A smart trash bin project that uses sensors and AI to detect and sort waste automatically.

## Features
- Object detection for different types of waste (plastic, metal, organic)
- Automatic lid opening and closing
- Smart sorting system
- [Optional] IoT-based notification for full bin

## Technologies Used
- Arduino / Raspberry Pi
- Python / C++
- Machine Learning (if applied)
- Sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, IR)

## How It Works
1. Sensors detect an object approaching.
2. AI model predicts the type of waste.
3. Bin sorts the waste into the correct compartment.
