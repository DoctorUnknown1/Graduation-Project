# Artificial Bin System (ABS)

An AI-powered smart bin management system developed entirely in software.  
This project combines machine learning, face recognition, database management, and an interactive graphical user interface to simulate an intelligent waste classification system.

## ðŸ›  Features
- **Face Recognition Login System** (using OpenCV + ML model)
- **Smart Waste Classification** into:
  - Plastic
  - Paper
  - Metal
  - Others
- **User Registration & Authentication** (with SQLite database)
- **Live Image Capture** and **Training Interface**
- **Real-time Classification Feedback** using ML predictions
- **Clean, Modern GUI** built with PyQt5

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used
- Python 3
- PyQt5 (for the GUI)
- OpenCV (for face recognition and image processing)
- SQLite (for database management)
- Machine Learning (custom neural network)
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
